Learn how to install, run the project, and add dynamic content using Google Spreadsheets

## Installation and quickstart
We use Jekyll. Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator.

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
2. Install Jekyll and [bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#bundler) [gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems)
```
gem install jekyll
```
3. Build the site and make it available on a local server
```
jekyll serve
```
4. Now browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Dynamic content
We use Google Spreadsheets as a CMS.

### Sponsor
1. Include the sponsor's logo in ```img/sponsor/``` using the file manager in cPanel or your Client FTP;
2. Fill out the sponsor information in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cu9buu8ibZl048JUK0hSiuPrN95qbIdNQbTICA2m5L8/edit#gid=47337489).

### Speaker
Coming soon.

## Deploy
Jekyll compiles all project files on ```/_site/```. Use your file manager in cPanel or your Client FTP to keep your hosted project identical to```/_site/```.
